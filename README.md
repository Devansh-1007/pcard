This repository is dedicated for all the open source contributors. It is beginner friendly and contains the collection of profile card of our contributors.

### What is Profile Card and why?

Just like a business card or a visiting card, we also have profile card. For example, keep all social media accounts in one place along with the headline. Profile card elements are combined with HTML and styled with CSS. You can refer to it as your mini-website.
In this digital age, an online personal website is essential for anyone looking for work.
If you don't have a personal website or are thinking of one, here's how you can create one. Then, you can share it with your friends and also add it to your resume/CV and many other purposes if you want.

I want to contribute but I don't know how to get started.
